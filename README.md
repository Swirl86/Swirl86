<h1 align="center">Hi üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I'm Susanne <br>‚ú® A passionate developer from Sweden ‚ú®</h1>

<p>
I use my GitHub to demonstrate my code structure, project organization, and problem-solving approach.<br>
I‚Äôm continuing to build my career as a developer, focusing on improving my coding skills and exploring new technologies.<br>
Some of the languages I enjoy working with are <b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Flutter</b>, and <b>React.js</b>, but I‚Äôm always excited to learan new languages and technologies.
</p>

<p>
Gaps in my GitHub contributions (from 2024 onwards) often reflect periods where I focus on studying theory, creating small test projects to explore new technologies, or completing programming challenges from potential employers. I use these opportunities to continuously improve my programming skills, even if it‚Äôs not immediately visible in the contribution graph.<br>
The largest gaps typically occur during summer and winter holidays when my children are off school.
